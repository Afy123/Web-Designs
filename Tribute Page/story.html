            <h1>ELON MUSK :</h1>
            <p class="headPara">
                Visionary entrepreneur Elon Musk is the charismatic co-founder of PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA), as well as the founder of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.
                He serves as CEO of Tesla and CEO/lead designer of SpaceX.His astounding success has given rise to comparisons to other visionary businessmen, such as Steve Jobs, Howard Hughes, Henry Ford, and Bill Gates. 
                After an often difficult childhood, Musk developed a relentless work ethic (he is known to work as many as 80 to 120 hours per week) and a tenacious, single-minded vision.
                As of 2021, he has an estimated total net worth of $151 billion. He is surpassed only by Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world. <br>
                Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, one of South Africa’s three capital cities. His father was an engineer, and his mother a model and nutritionist. He is the oldest of three children, all high-achievers: His brother,
                Kimbal Musk, is a venture capitalist and environmentalist. His sister, Tosca Musk, is an award-winning producer and director. <br>After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived primarily with his father.
                He would later dub the man "a terrible human being… almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. “I had a terrible upbringing.
                I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don’t face enough adversity,” Musk would later say.By his own account, Musk a self-described bookworm and something of a smart aleck—he read voraciously,
                everything from encyclopedias to comic books. But Musk’s intellectual aptitude did him few favors as a child. He found few friends in the tough-minded Afrikaner culture he encountered in school.
                If there was a point of bright escape for Musk; it was technology. When he was only 10, he became acquainted with programming via the Commodore VIC-20, an inexpensive home computer. Before long, he had become proficient enough to create 
                Blastar—a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a magazine called PC and Office Technology for $500. <br> <b>X.com :</b> <br>
                In 1995, with $28,000 and his younger brother Kimbal at his side, Musk started Zip2, a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq’s AltaVista web search engine for a whopping $340 million.
                Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com, which he intended to shape into the future of banking. <br> <b>Tesla : </b> <br> First, he contributed funding—about $70 million.7 Then, in 2004, Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help run Tesla Motors,
                where Musk was integral in designing the Tesla Roadster, an electric car. Although After Eberhard was ousted from the firm in 2007, following a series of disagreements, Musk seized management control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch, Tesla has become
                one of the world’s most popular and coveted car brands. <br> In addition to producing electric vehicles, Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space, thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.Founded in 2006, this clean-energy-services company currently produces two rechargeable solar batteries, mainly 
                used for stationary energy storage purposes.24 The smaller Powerwall was developed for home backup power and off-the-grid use, while the larger Powerpack is intended for commercial or electric utility grid use. <br> <b>SpaceX :</b> <br> Musk used much of the proceeds of his PayPal sale to found Space Exploration
                Technologies Corporation, commonly known as SpaceX, an interstellar travel company. By his own account, Musk spent $100 million to found SpaceX in 2002.
                With SpaceX, Musk landed several high-profile contracts with NASA and the U.S. Air Force to design rockets and conduct military missions. Musk has been vocal about his plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.
                Musk’s early interests in philosophy, science fiction, and fantasy novels are reflected in his sense of idealism and concern with human progress—and in his business career. He works in the areas that he has identified as crucial to our future, specifically the Internet, the transition to renewable energy sources, 
                and space colonization. He has defied critics, disrupted industries, and made advances in all three of these frontiers, via his creation of PayPal, Tesla Motors, SolarCity, 
                and SpaceX—game-changers all, despite their sometimes rocky performance.
